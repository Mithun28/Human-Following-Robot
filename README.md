# Human-Following-Robot
This project features an Arduino robot with two IR sensors and an ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection. The IR sensors detect nearby objects on either side, while the ultrasonic sensor measures front distances. A motor driver shield controls four motors, allowing the robot to move and turn based on sensor inputs to navigate around obstacles.
